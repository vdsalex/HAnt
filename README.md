Considering that each hospital is equipped with sensors tracking the environment for biological or fire hazards, and there is a knowledge-based system – based on Wikidata and specific information offered by WikiDoc or similar knowledge sources – which "knows" the room of each patient and their medical condition, develop a multi-device application able to help the fire/police department or medical personnel to prioritize the evacuation of patients in case of a fire/earthquake or any other kind of significant (natural) hazard – for useful data, visit Severe Weather Data Inventory. Design a real-time (rule-based) system which will act as an aid to the rescue squad or medical staff on such scenarios, eventually based on certain defined rescue plan(s) – for example, children and young persons having non-terminal illness will be considered a priority for evacuation, superior floors will be first evacuated, etc. Critical data, plus various statistics, will be available via a SPARQL endpoint. See also a list of health-related APIs and Health and Lifesciences Extension to schema.org. Bonus: the use of a publish/subscribe approach – for additional info, study WebSub (W3C Specification), PubSubHubbub, and DDS (Data Distribution Service).
